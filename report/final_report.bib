@article{Gopalakrishnan2005,
abstract = {The airline industry is faced with some of the largest scheduling problems of any industry. The crew scheduling problem involves the optimal allocation of crews to flights. Over the last two decades the magnitude and complexity of crew scheduling problems have grown enormously and airlines are relying more on automated mathematical procedures as a practical necessity. In this paper we survey different approaches studied and discuss the state-of-the-art in solution methodology for the airline crew scheduling problem.We conclude with a discussion about promising areas for further work to make it possible to get very good solutions for the crew scheduling problem.},

@article{Rushmeier1997,
abstract = {We present an advanced model for the formulation and solution of large scale fleet assignment problems that arise in the scheduling of air transportation. Fleet assignment determines the type of aircraft to operate each flight in a given schedule, subject to a variety of side constraints, due to marketing, operational, maintenance and crew restrictions. We model the problem as mixed-integer multicommodity flow on networks encoding activities linking flight departures. We focus on fully representing flight connection possibilities, while accurately capturing complex operational rules. We also provide a unified framework for the expression of resource constraints via piecewise linear penalties, which permits a profitability-based tradeoff between operational goals and revenue. Computational results on actual schedules show that high quality assignments for one-day problems can be obtained within an hour of computation. The use of the model at USAir results in an annual benefit of at least \$15 million.},

@article{Schefczyk1993,
abstract = {This study presents a new approach for measuring operational performance, an important facet of performance missing in the current literature concerned with international airline strategy. International performance assessments of airlines from published financial information are difficult, because (1) most airlines lease a substantial fraction of their aircraft, and (2) different accounting and taxation rules in various countries result in different impacts of leased assets on profit and balance-sheet information. A possible solution are nonfinancial data. For example, the number of available ton kilometers may reflect aircraft capacity more accurately than flight equipment depreciation. However, different units of measurement introduce new difficulties. Drawing on data from 15 airlines, this study utilizes 'Data Envelopment Analysis' as a technique to analyze and compare operational performance of airlines. The study concludes with an analysis of strategic factors of high profitability and performance in the airline industry.},
